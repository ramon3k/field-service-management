## Admin User Management

### Automated Creation (Recommended)
When using the automated deployment script:
1. Script automatically creates admin user
2. Generates secure 12-character random password
3. Displays credentials at end of deployment
4. User must save credentials and change password immediately

### Manual Creation
If deploying manually or script fails:
1. Edit `database\create-initial-admin.sql`
2. Set company code, username, and password
3. Run script against database
4. Save credentials securely

### Password Recovery
If admin password is forgotten:
1. Edit `database\reset-admin-password.sql`
2. Set company code, username, and new password
3. Run script against database
4. Log in with new password

**MIT License** - Most permissive
- Allows commercial use
- Minimal restrictions
- Simple and short
- Wide adoption

### For Commercial Distribution
**Proprietary License** - Full control
- Define usage terms
- Restrict redistribution
- Require license key
- Include support terms

### For Hybrid Approach
**Dual License** - Best of both
- MIT for open source community
- Commercial license for enterprise
- Provide additional services
- Generate revenue from support
